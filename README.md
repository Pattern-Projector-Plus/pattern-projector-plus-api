# Pattern Projector Plus API


## Run
First download the required packages
```
npm install
```
Next run the dev server:

```
npm run dev
```

API is served at localhost:5000 by default.

Currently, you can change this by modifying `/src/server.ts`. Configuration via .env file is the next planned feature.
